# PGA-Tour-Comparisons
PGA Tour comparison that takes an individual PGA golfers average stats and shows the relationship of those stats compared to the PGA Tour average.
This program was written to scrape data on PGA golfers and their stats for a given season/year. The data that was scraped is the Top 50 golfers relative to the average lowest score. The main part of the code allows the user to input a golfers name (based on list of golfers available to chose from) and compare that particular users stats with the average for the remaining 49 golfers in the data. I also included a section of code at the end that can be uncommented and will compare the PGA average to your own averages as long as you know your average score, average green in regulation, and average fairways hit.
